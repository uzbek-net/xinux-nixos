# Web editor

The Web Editor contains a set of features to increase the accessibility of complex tools like git, setup, review flows, contributions, and visualizing components. 

Here is an overview of the web editor structure:

### Header

    - **Add Devtools**: Set up devtools to facilitate your work and automatize repetitive tasks.

**3. Connections**
    - **Avatars**: See who's currently online and click to follow their steps.

**4. Collaborate**

### Sidebar

The sidebar is a quick way to operate and navigate your codebase. It allows you to:

- View and manipulate your files
- Search inside your Repository
- Interact with source control

You can change the sidebar view using the icons at the top.

### Code Editor

The code editor is where the magic happens ✨. We provide a base experience for all developers, with support for:

- Code formatting (Prettier or ESLint)
- LSP
- Intellisense
- Code completion
- Optimized syntax highlight
- Ligatures
- Multiple Editors
- Diff view

 If you want more advanced features, you can download our [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CodeSandbox-io.codesandbox-projects) and [open the Repository in your local IDE](/learn/editors/vscode/setting-up-vscode) with your own customizations.

### DevTools

CodeSandbox signature layout with three columns and a runnable preview is back with superpowers. The new panel on the right supports useful tools to help you complete your work faster and more efficiently. Read more about it [here](devtools).

### Layout

CodeSandbox Web Editor allows you to customize the three-panel layout to maximize the space for the task you are working on. Hover the mouse near the edge of each column to see the resize cursor; click and hold to change the layout. 

After reaching the proportional limit, keep dragging to hide the entire column.
