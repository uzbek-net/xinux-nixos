# Storybook Addon

The [@codesandbox/storybook-addon](https://github.com/codesandbox/storybook-addon) allows you to open the code from a story in a Sandbox with the click of a button.

This integration allows you to transform design system documentation into interactive example. We have found this incredibly useful for interactive learning and for sharing bug reproductions.

## Connecting Storybook to your workspace

All Sandboxes created from the Storybook addon will be created within the workspace that is listed in the [configuration](#configuration).

Anyone opening a Sandbox from the addon will need to be a part of the workspace in order to access the Sandbox.
Luckily organization domains make it very easy for new users to join automatically.

If a workspace has an organzation domain, when a new user opens a Sandbox from a Storybook addon, they will be asked to join the workspace if they have an account with an email that matches the domain of the organization.

You can find a step-by-step guide for setting a domain on the [Organization](/learn/access/organizations#creating-an-organization) documentation.

## Configuration

```js
// .storybook/main.js

module.exports = {
  // ...
  addons: ['@codesandbox/storybook-addon'],
};

```

To run the addon, you'll need to configure it in your Storybook's `.storybook/preview.js` file.

```js
// .storybook/preview.js

const preview: Preview = {
  parameters: {
    codesandbox: {
      /**
       * @required
       * Workspace API key from codesandbox.io/t/permissions.
       * This sandbox is created inside the given workspace
       * and can be shared with team members.
       */
      apiToken: <api-token>,

      /**
       * @required
       * Dependencies list to be installed in the sandbox.
       *
       * @note You cannot use local modules or packages since
       * this story runs in an isolated environment (sandbox)
       * inside CodeSandbox. As such, the sandbox doesn't have
       * access to your file system.
       *
       * Example:
       */
      dependencies: {
        "@radix-ui/themes": "latest",
        "@myscope/mypackage": "1.0.0",
      },

      /**
       * @required
       * CodeSandbox will try to import all components by default from
       * the given package, in case `mapComponent` property is not provided.
       *
       * This property is useful when your components imports are predictable
       * and come from a single package and entry point.
       */
      fallbackImport: "@radix-ui/themes",

      /**
       * @optional
       * All required providers to run the sandbox properly,
       * such as themes, i18n, store, and so on.
       *
       * @note Remember to use only the dependencies listed above.
       *
       * Example:
       */
      provider: `import { Theme } from "@radix-ui/themes";
        import '@radix-ui/themes/styles.css';

        export default ThemeProvider = ({ children }) => {
          return (
            <Theme>
              {children}
            </Theme>
          )
        }`,
    },
  },
};

export default preview;

Make sure to provide the necessary values for [`apiToken`](https://codesandbox.io/t/permissions) and any additional dependencies or providers required for your specific setup.

For now, this addon only supports the [Component Story Format (CSF)](https://storybook.js.org/docs/api/csf) stories format.

### Additional Notes

- Ensure that you have proper permissions and access rights to the CodeSandbox workspace specified in the configuration.
- Verify the correctness of the dependencies and providers listed in the configuration to ensure the sandbox runs smoothly.
