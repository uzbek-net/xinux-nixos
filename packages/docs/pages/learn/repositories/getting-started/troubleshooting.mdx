# Troubleshooting
   
## **Permission errors while importing a project**
    
- Verify your team's permission to open CodeSandbox Repositories.

- Verify your **repository permissions on GitHub**. 
You need to have `write` permission on GitHub to be able to import the project. Repositories where you only have `read` access can only be forked.

- Verify your **GitHub permissions**. 
CodeSandbox requires full git access to be able to import and commit. If you face any authentication errors, follow the steps listed below to reset your GitHub permissions.
    
## **Resetting GitHub permissions**

1. Go to the **[Dashboard](https://codesandbox.io/dashboard)**.

1. Click on the **Menu icon** at the top right of the screen.

1. Click on **Preferences**.
