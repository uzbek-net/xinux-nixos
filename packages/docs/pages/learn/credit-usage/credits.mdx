# Credits

Credits serve as the unit of measurement for VM runtime. They simplify understanding and managing the costs of running your Devboxes and Repositories. One credit equates to a specific amount of resources used per hour, which ensures clarity and transparency in your billing.

| VM size | Credits / hour | Cost / hour | CPU      | RAM    |
| ------ | -------------- | ----------- | -------- | ------ |
| Nano   | 10 credits     | $0.18       | 2 cores  | 4 GB   |
| Micro  | 20 credits     | $0.36       | 4 cores  | 8 GB   |
| Small  | 40 credits     | $0.72       | 8 cores  | 16 GB  |
| Medium | 80 credits     | $1.44       | 16 cores | 32 GB  |
| Large  | 160 credits    | $2.88       | 32 cores | 64 GB  |
| XLarge | 320 credits    | $5.76       | 64 cores | 128 GB |

Sandboxes do not run on VMs, so any time spent on a Sandbox will not count toward your credit spend.

## Types of credits

### Subscription credits 
Subscription credits are allocated monthly credits per workspace according to the subscription plan. A workspace on the free plan gets 400 credits per month. The Pro plan has a base of 1000 credits a month, but more can be purchased with credit add-ons.

Unused credits do not roll over month-to-month.

### On-demand credits 
Once subscription credits have been used, VM usage will begin running on on-demand credits. These credits will be tracked and billed at the end of the billing cycle. 
On-demand credits are not subject to discount and are billed at a standard $0.18 per hour.

To prevent unexpected bills due to unusually high on-demand credit usage, every Pro workspace is required to set a [spending limit](/learn/credit-usage/controlling-usage#spending-limit).
