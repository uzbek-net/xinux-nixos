# Usage-based Billing

Our usage-based billing system is designed to provide a flexible and cost-effective approach to managing your workspace and using our Devboxes and Repositories. It's based on a credit system, where credits translate virtual machine (VM) runtime per hour into precise costs.

## Key components
### Virtual Machines
Our Devboxes and Repositories run on VMs, which allow you to develop, review and preview your software projects. As such, VMs are the backbone of our usage measurement.

### Credits

Credits serve as the unit of measurement for VM runtime. They simplify understanding and managing the costs of running your Devboxes and Repositories. One credit equates to a specific amount of resources used per hour, which ensures clarity and transparency in your billing.
More details can be found [here](/learn/credit-usage/credits).

### Storage
Each subscription tier has a specific storage limit. The storage refers to the VM disk space limit of _each_ Devbox or Repository branch running in that workspace.
For example, the Free tier includes 20 GB of storage. So, every Devbox or Repository branch running on a VM will have 20 GB of storage.
If the storage included in your subscription tier isn't enough, you can upgrade to a higher tier of Pro.
